# Native Text Input for Flutter

A text input widget built using the native `UITextView` on iOS and `EditText` on Android. For text view, please refer to [flutter-native-text-view](https://github.com/henryleunghk/flutter-native-text-view).

```
Android support is added in v2 ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
```
For existing project(s) using v1, please refer to [migration guide](migration-to-v2.md) here.

## Installation

Follow the instructions from https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_text_input/install

## Why you should use this

Many mobile app users are used to the subtle features provided by the native iOS or Android systems. Even though Flutter provides a lot of useful widgets, many Flutter developers will notice that `TextField` or `CupertinoTextField` provided by Flutter are [not on par with their native counterpart][1].

The above shows just one of the missing text editing features in Flutter's `TextField`, when comparing to the native iOS `UITextView`. Features like these are especially important if you're building an app that involves a lot of text composition (messaging, editing document, and so on).

To address this, this package simply wraps the native `UITextView` (and `EditText` for Android) as a Flutter widget.

Hope you find it useful and happy coding! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
